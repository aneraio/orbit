The Orbit Module Stack marks the debut of our open-source contributions to the orbital habitat ecosystem, tailored to seamlessly integrate the innovative spirit of MIT Orbit into our unique environment. Spearheaded by Julia, our advanced AI system, this stack is meticulously designed to translate and adapt MIT Orbit's rich repository of entrepreneurial resources, tools, and insights, making them accessible and beneficial to the members of our orbital habitat. By offering detailed guidance on the setup and utilization of each module and tool, Julia aids in fostering a vibrant ecosystem where entrepreneurship and innovation thrive beyond the bounds of Earth. As the main network of our orbital habitat continues to evolve discreetly, we invite pioneers and visionaries to join us in this unparalleled journey of discovery and growth. Early access is available to those eager to contribute to and benefit from this groundbreaking integration.
